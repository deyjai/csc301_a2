# Docker

**NOTE: These scripts can only be run from the csc301 VM located at the port specified on Piazza.**

## Docker setup

There are two shell scripts in this directory:

- `start_docker.sh`: This script will start the docker containers for both the database and the redis cache.
- `kill_docker.sh`: This script will stop the docker containers for both the database and the redis cache.

## Running the scripts

- Ensure that the scripts are executable by running `chmod +x start_docker.sh kill_docker.sh`.
- Alternatively, run `bash start_docker.sh` and `bash kill_docker.sh`.
